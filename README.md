Weather Buddy

This project uses the Open Weather API to allow a user to search for weather in their local area.  Using local storage, users can store their previously searched locations and easily check the weather in those locations as well.

Each search yields the current weather for that location, as well as the five-day forecast for that location.  Details include temp, humidity, and a text description of the weather.

It uses React for dynamic rendering.
